This is some semi-useful information to know about this bot.

1.) It was created using Discordia with the coding language Lua
2.) It has no "intended" purpose, use it for whatever you need to.
3.) This project was started on 10/25/2019 at 11:38 PM.
4.) The bot token and other things were hidden.

5.) This was released to open-source so developers could understand Discordia a little better and hopefully use Lua to create their bots.
It's a great coding language, really.
